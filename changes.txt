Added monster races which have no class and have natural powers and can gain natural AC and speed as they level, and at set levels can evolve into different forms that have new stats, flags and powers
changed the equip item interface slightly so it shows all slots
changed player dumps so they only show full slots
score is registered for cheaters and suicides
changed max xp to = max gold, because why not
quickstart disabled.. evolution screws it up

Progression:
2h hydra -lvl 8-> 3h hydra -15-> 4h hydra -23-> 5h hydra -30-> 7h hydra -37-> 9h hydra -45-> 11h hydra

baby red dragon -10-> young red dragon -20-> mature red dragon -30-> ancient red dragon -40-> great hell wyrm
					|					|-> chaos drake -35-> great wyrm of chaos -45-> GWOB
					|->baby MHD -17-> young MHD -25-> mature MHD -35-> ancient MHD  -45-> GWOMC
repeat for white, green, black, blue

baby gold dragon -10-> young gd -20-> mature gd -30-> ancient gd -40-> GWOT
								|-> law drake -35-> great wyrm of law -45-> GWOB
crystal drake 	-25-> GCD

TODO:
from high to low priority:
fix bugs with sust/res display on character sheet
infinite home room
powers for MHD
?acq should choose something slot-appropriate

implement new flags (pois blood, super regen, imm pois)
level 30 monsters should have about 5 net bonus points to stats
more monster races (easy)
summoning (med)
quests (easy)
add fire_arc, change br weapons to use it
"king" monsters (no idea)
terrain, terrain modifying spells (e.g. Ainur spells) (med)
possessors (hard)
monster alignment - law/chaos (easy)
invisibility/blindness (easy)

my own TODO:
add Nick's sweet egos
add different classes for monsters: monster (base kind), possessor (doesn't evolve but can deincarnate and grab new bodies),
	chaosspawn (50% chance to evolve every level, evolves into random body based on lvl)

bugs:
screen redrawing means messages before evolution are dropped
level gain messages can be displayed 2x if they occur after evolving
can't use 'repeat command' with race powers
powers can't use HP in lieu of mana (feature or bug?)
pval of starting items is set in stone (feature or bug?)
equippy chars don't display (design problem.. how to deal with a line too long?)
innate melee info not displayed
BAD PROGRAMMING: racial powers files should be in their own folder and better organized, I lazily copied them from pos
equipment/resistance/sustain display on char screen messed up
eq slots past 23 aren't labelled correctly
"Replace which ring" prompt doesn't respond correctly to choices.
Troll powers berserk and resistance need to redraw screen
