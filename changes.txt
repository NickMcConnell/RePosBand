Added monster races which have no class and have natural powers and can gain natural AC and speed as they level, and at set levels can evolve into different forms that have new stats, flags and powers
changed the equip item interface slightly so it shows all slots
changed player dumps so they only show full slots
changed character sheet to 3 seperate pages
score is registered for suicides
changed max xp to = max gold, because why not
quickstart disabled.. evolution screws it up
acquirement changed so that it generates objects based on the farthest depths you've reached, not current depth.. also only grants items you can use


Progression:
2h hydra -lvl 8-> 3h hydra -15-> 4h hydra -23-> 5h hydra -30-> 7h hydra -37-> 9h hydra -45-> 11h hydra

baby red dragon -10-> young red dragon -20-> mature red dragon -30-> ancient red dragon -40-> great hell wyrm
					|					|-> chaos drake -35-> great wyrm of chaos -45-> GWOB
					|->baby MHD -17-> young MHD -25-> mature MHD -35-> ancient MHD  -45-> GWOMC
repeat for white, green, black, blue

baby gold dragon -10-> young gd -20-> mature gd -30-> ancient gd -40-> GWOT
								|-> law drake -35-> great wyrm of law -45-> GWOB

TODO:
from high to low priority:
more monster races (easy)
implement new flags (pois blood, super regen, imm pois)
more powers for new monsters
infinite home room (put on hold)
"king" monsters (easy)
summoning (hard)
quests (easy)
level 30 monsters should have about 5 net bonus points to stats - rationalize stat points, flags, hp, xp across monsters.. then do it all while blindfolded and on fire
add fire_arc, change br weapons to use it
terrain, terrain modifying spells (e.g. Ainur spells) (med)
possessors (hard)
monster alignment - law/chaos (easy)
invisibility/blindness (easy)

my own TODO:
add Nick's sweet egos
add different classes for monsters: monster (base kind), possessor (doesn't evolve but can deincarnate and grab new bodies),
	chaosspawn (50% chance to evolve every level, evolves into random body based on lvl)

bugs:
screen redrawing means messages before evolution are dropped
level gain messages can be displayed 2x if they occur after evolving
can't use 'repeat command' with race powers
powers can't use HP in lieu of mana (feature or bug?)
pval of starting items is set in stone (feature or bug?)
equippy chars don't display on main screen(design problem.. how to deal with a line too long?)
innate melee info not displayed
innate melee doesn't ID-by-use rings of dam/acc/slay
BAD PROGRAMMING: racial powers files should be in their own folder and better organized, I lazily copied them from pos
eq slots past 23 aren't labelled correctly
monsters probably (untested) try to use poison against IM_POIS players, even if smart_monsters turned on
player dumps show level X being achieved multiple times, eg:
    215913   2000'   31   Reached level 31
    215942   2000'   31   Found The Leather Scale Mail 'Thalkettoth'
    224523   2100'   31   Reached level 31
    226574   2100'   31   Reached level 31
this might be bc of !restore XP
